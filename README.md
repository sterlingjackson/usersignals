analytics.js

Supports capturing browser errors, pageviews, custom events, clicks and form submissions.

You will need to update analytics.path to point to the domain your API endpoints reside on and develop endpoints to handle the JSON payload sent by analytics.js.

analytics.path = 'https://www.domain.com/';
